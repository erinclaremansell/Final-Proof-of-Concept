We've actually we started with our daughter at a school that was a moving towards the open plan learning environment where they would have say, you know, 60 children in one space. With for example, maybe three teachers and we decided to move away from that cause we felt that for our daughter's we felt that they would sort of thrive more in an intimate learning environment where, I guess, the ratios of teachers to students was, you know, a lot more advantageous to their learning.<br><a href='#Class size+b'>Back<a><br><br><b><font color='red'> Interview1edited [1506:1902] </font></b><br><br>Small numbers, small class sizes, definitely a priority for both of my kids to have the learning environment suited to them. I think once you get too big in class sizes they can get a bit lost. When they've got the smaller class sizes it's easier to identify for the teacher when the kids need a bit of help. It just stops them from going under the radar I suppose.

I won't go over. I wouldn't like to be in a situation where there's a lot more just because kindies being 5 years old, some of them are going to be young kindies, some of them are going to be old kindies. Some of them are going to have less attention compared to others. I just think it would be a bit disruptive if there was more.

There was a table, they had their iPads and they had, I think, a little maths exercise and there was a few of them of them, I think, in the wet area which is the craft area. I thnk there was maybe a mum there at the time but it was organised and it was, it was, it was almost lovely. Where as Mrs P's class at the time seemed a bit more, I think those children were maybe a bit older, that was a kindy/one class and it was less warm. It was just, although she was, she was nice but, and they were doing the same thing, there was children there that were reading and writing but there was more going on in the background. There was children moving around and I wasn't really sure what they were doing. Where is in Mrs S's class,everyone seemed to at that time. That was about a year ago that I would have had that tour. An of course she took me around the other classes but I wasn't as focussed on them. I was more focussed on the kindy class at the time so I can't remember too much about the other classes or classroom but they just seemed very peaceful there, that day I went. And um, yeah that was definitely a positive,  that was one of the positives I took away and told my husband that I think maybe G is the right choice<br><a href='#Classroom environment+b'>Back<a><br><br><hr><p align='center'><b><font color='blue' size='+2'>1 Coding of <a id='Creative'>"Creative"</a> from 1 file.</b></font><hr><p align='left'><b><font color='red'> Interview3edited [389:397] </font></b><br><br>Creative<br><a href='#Creative+b'>Back<a><br><br><hr><p align='center'><b><font color='blue' size='+2'>1 Coding of <a id='Curriculum'>"Curriculum"</a> from 1 file.</b></font><hr><p align='left'><b><font color='red'> Interview1edited [2651:3086] </font></b><br><br>We wanted them to do a second language that was not of an Asian orient.

She's always said she's bored and craved extra. I've always pushed her at home and last year she sat the NAPLAN and the school assured me it's nothing to look at it, but anyway, she's excelled and basically they're just not interested. I've called the diocese and they've said, you know, 'we teach to their inner diversity. I hope you understand that'. And I do get that but then in some ways I think 'Am I sending her to the right school?'' You know, should I send her to a public school where they've got their schools that excel and give her that opportunity. You know, am I doing the wrong thing by moving her because, you know, I could be reading into the NAPLAN results, but you know, if she's coming home  every day since year one saying she's bored I just don't agree with that because they do extend, like they do help the kids that are struggling and I just don't know why the teachers, that like that school teacher can't come on board, the stage leader, there's enough people there	that can come on board. Yeah, and when I did call the diocese and talk to them about it, it actually still was on their website. So do you know what I mean? They said 'no, no'. Well, I said 'no, no, actually it's on your website. They said 'well we need to take it down because we don't do that.<br><a href='#Engaging+b'>Back<a><br><br><b><font color='red'> Interview4edited [20771:21362] </font></b><br><br>I don't know really thought they would have pushed her more than they have so far and I did meet with them a few weeks in and I didn't like, I didn't say 'oh she's had such a good NAPLAN results' but I did mention that she's quite smart and I'd like to extend her at home. I haven't really gotten anything yet. I just think it's helpful. They're just lucky. Where as she could go to high school in a few years where she could have been one of those kids that had the high accelerant learning and she could already have been up that little bit higher instead of being bored and wasting away. <br><a href='#Engaging+b'>Back<a><br><br><hr><p align='center'><b><font color='blue' size='+2'>1 Coding of <a id='Enjoyable'>"Enjoyable"</a> from 1 file.</b></font><hr><p align='left'><b><font color='red'> Interview1edited [6467:6481] </font></b><br><br>kids are happy<br><a href='#Enjoyable+b'>Back<a><br><br><hr><p align='center'><b><font color='blue' size='+2'>3 Codings of <a id='Flexible'>"Flexible"</a> from 2 files.</b></font><hr><p align='left'><b><font color='red'> Interview1edited [8510:8589] </font></b><br><br>boys need to be active so they're not just sitting at their desks all the time.<br><a href='#Flexible+b'>Back<a><br><br><b><font color='red'> Interview3edited [1135:1262] </font></b><br><br>a place where they can show their abilities and not be set with too much restriction in terms of everyone doing the same thing,<br><a href='#Flexible+b'>Back<a><br><br><b><font color='red'> Interview3edited [2550:3223] </font></b><br><br>We were looking for classrooms that had a little bit more flexibility with, you know, where they sit and not always working with the same children so lots of different dynamics in order to make him feel very well supported with like minded peers as well as being able to move about within different groups depending on the area of learning, of what they were doing, so for example in mathematics he's very confident and needs to be with children that help extend his interests but at the same time, for example, literacy he is very capable and able but needs a little bit more support with comprehension and things like that so um grouping doesn't always match his ability.<br><a href='#Flexible+b'>Back<a><br><br><hr><p align='center'><b><font color='blue' size='+2'>1 Coding of <a id='Harmonious'>"Harmonious"</a> from 1 file.</b></font><hr><p align='left'><b><font color='red'> Interview5edited [400:906] </font></b><br><br>I would say that you would need some type of harmony, some sort of structure as well, to the classroom, so that those kids can understand what's going to happen next door what's asked of them.

I like that there's open communication, in terms of like an email or phone if there's an issue so I don't feel like he's having to fend for himself without that adult parent support and I'd say that there's a sense of community there so you know just making sure that children feel like they're valued and I suppose that comes in time as well and it comes with getting to know the children and because there's so few of them that's happening maybe a lot faster than if he was in a school with 90 year ones. So I feel that what we're going through in terms of our family and the experiences we're having because of the children that we have, that that would happen wherever we were but the fact that they are so small and that they do factor in each individual child that the outcomes and the results and the needs and the support we need is coming to us faster than it would if we were a high number school.<br><a href='#Intimate+b'>Back<a><br><br><b><font color='red'> Interview4edited [22783:23395] </font></b><br><br>Are you still concerned that 28 is too many students for a class?<p>Res: I think I am.

You know, 'the teacher doesn't have enough time to for me'. So that's what made me really realise how big these classes actually are and the teacher said, oh no he just came from Bilpin and he's used to 7.

It's a beautiful school and I told the principal she's got a beautiful school. My issue was a lot of the older kids in wheelchairs, typically like C, just didn't have any communication device, no specs no iPods, no nothing and that was something that really struck home. That this can't be somewhere that C goes. I appealed with the panel and I told them firmly that C can't go to T. The travel just isn't right. I told the principal that day and she assured me that I had to pick T because there's no other schools that will take him for the next year.

Was this something you were looking for that you were hoping would also translate into classroom learning experiences as well or were you more looking at the learning environment, the natural environment, like as the natural playground?<p>Res: I'd say both so I think the way the world is going children have less time Outdoors. They sepnd of alot time on technology. Work life is so extensive in comparison to when I was growing up. I remember playing outside lots after school and we weren't really over-scheduled. We were just coming home to play with our neighbours and our friends and I feel that children of today don't really have the same opportunities so I really was looking for a school where our children can play in the natural settings and be around animals and be able to explore nature without it having to be late in the evenings when we are coming home from work or after school activities. I love that they've got animals at the school so they come into the classroom and I think it's such a	calming thing for children to do. Sometimes when my child was upset in kindergarten he would be allowed to spend some time with the animals and look after them and care for them. I think that's a really nice way of feeling that sense of calm rather than being excluded from activities or feeling different to other children so it's a great way to bring that nature into the classrooms with children being able to have pets at school when they might not be able to have them at home.<br><a href='#Natural+b'>Back<a><br><br><hr><p align='center'><b><font color='blue' size='+2'>8 Codings of <a id='Nurturing'>"Nurturing"</a> from 4 files.</b></font><hr><p align='left'><b><font color='red'> Int2edited2 [ 3504: 3595] </font></b><br><br>the learning environment that we were looking for was a kind, caring, nurturing environment<br><a href='#Nurturing+b'>Back<a><br><br><b><font color='red'> Int2edited2 [ 8273: 8414] </font></b><br><br>place that she feels comfortable in, that she feels cared for, that she feels able to use her voice if she needs to and that that's supported<br><a href='#Nurturing+b'>Back<a><br><br><b><font color='red'> Int2edited2 [12525:13140] </font></b><br><br>Int: What is it about the environment that makes it nurturing?<p>Res: I think it is again, sorry I keep harping on it, I think it is because it's small and I think the teachers get a really good opportunity to know the children quite well in comparison to if there was, you know, comparing it to the open plan learning and I've actually got a friend who's a teacher in open plan learning and who doesn't enjoyed it at all and doesn't feel that sort of connection with his students in that sort of learning environment because he doesn't get the opportunity to give an individual child child attention if they need it.<br><a href='#Nurturing+b'>Back<a><br><br><b><font color='red'> Interview1edited [ 1085: 1106] </font></b><br><br>nurturing environment<br><a href='#Nurturing+b'>Back<a><br><br><b><font color='red'> Interview1edited [  424:  434] </font></b><br><br>Supportive<br><a href='#Nurturing+b'>Back<a><br><br><b><font color='red'> Interview3edited [ 5557: 5920] </font></b><br><br>The pastoral care, knowing the individual child and not just, that child is part of a group.

They do a really good balance of faith and life at this school so they get the education based on the Christian teaching and Christian beliefs and Christian ethics but it doesn't get shoved down their throat. Some of the other schools we did look at were not as open if the kids had questions or didn't believe that this is the way it was. They weren't open to discuss other avenues with the kids where as we felt that with this school, if kids had questions about Christianity or God, they would be able to explore it rather than be told no this is the way it is. Both the kids actually love their faith and life lessons. We encourage that at home and we just wanted that basis of at least having a Christian basis and the school 5 minutes up the road is completely non-denominational. They don't celebrate anything, so there's no Christmas trees at Christmas. They do Ramadan but they don't celebrate anything to do with Christianity as such which just was not what we wanted for our kids. We wanted Christmas trees at Christmas, we wanted them to know the story of Jesus. Easter, they were totally across what the Easter celebration is about.<br><a href='#Religious education+b'>Back<a><br><br><b><font color='red'> Interview4edited [ 6100: 6779] </font></b><br><br>I didn't really know anyone in the area and to me they were just two Catholic school.

The outdoor environment's beautiful. It's lots of acrage, trees, it's a really natural setting but it wasn't too overwhelming because it was sort of fenced off in sections so that children felt still very close to their teachers and different buildings and their school bags and their lunch boxes, and it wasn't like they were going out to some big oval and having to fend for themselves  during their unstructured times of the day as well. So that sense of belonging and security was really important.<br><a href='#School environment+b'>Back<a><br><br><hr><p align='center'><b><font color='blue' size='+2'>1 Coding of <a id='School policies'>"School policies"</a> from 1 file.</b></font><hr><p align='left'><b><font color='red'> Interview1edited [4622:4952] </font></b><br><br>So I suppose also their bullying policies, the way they actually address issues like that, the programs they have in place.

The reason we didn't choose that school was because it was massive. It was huge. It still had small class sizes but there was 4 classes in a grade as opposed to where we are now where there is only 1 class per grade. I didn't feel, it just didn't have that same sort of nurturing kind of feel to it, as opposed to the current school that we are at.<br><a href='#School size+b'>Back<a><br><br><b><font color='red'> Int2edited2 [ 7098: 7708] </font></b><br><br>Int: So what would you say was the main factor when you made that final decision on the school that your daughter's currently at. What was probably the major factor?<p>Res: I would say, the school size, to be honest. I think that probably sums it up because I didn't want our little girl just to be a number, and for, you know if there was a problem at school or a problem with her learning or anything at all where she was unhappy I wanted her to be treated as an individual and I wanted that to be valued as opposed to just, you know, just sort of fobbed off or whatever.

The children that have been placed next to him, I think, are there to support him so the person he's currently sitting next to is very friendly outgoing girl who tends to sort of mother him and tells him what to do if he was unsure. She is quite a chatty person from what I hear so it sort of brings out that comfort in my child and he feels like he can easily talk to this child and ask for direction or resssurance without them shutting him down and telling him that he's got to ask the teacher or that he's been annoying, or whatever. So she seems to be a good fit. Last term he was around his friends which he really liked.
